MyGoals SinatraMVC

This application is a MVC CRUD Sinatra Application that has user authentication for users to be able to keep track of their goals. Users can create, read, update and delete their goals, and also see the goals of other users on the /goals page. The home screen on this application explains why creating goals is important for success, and shows off the most recent user to have completed a goal.

Getting Started
 
In order to use this application, go to your terminal type 'git clone git@github.com:JaysonKesterson/SinatraMVC.git'. Then cd into SinatraMVC and bundle install (this will install the gems necessary to run the program). After this is complete, start a local host with the shotgun command in the terminal, paste the server host url given by shotgun in the terminal into a browser URL and the application should be running.
